Ideally something with external interactions to Files, Databased, Rest/WebServices, etc

HotelBooking application:
	- Already studied
	- Command line interface (simple)
	- Database interactions using MySQL
	- repo: https://github.com/Rider8547/HotelMe
	
Address Book ?
	- Simple apps
	- MVC
	- Uses Files

JPass
	- Swing
	- Uses Files
	- repo:	https://github.com/gaborbata/jpass
	- Possibility of running regression tests

JMemorize
	- Swing
	- Not sure it uses files
	- repo: https://github.com/riadd/jMemorize


It would be nice to have other test subjects which use network or web services. Maybe some XMPP/WS/Rest
Last resort we can play around with CodeDefenders (not sure how we can handle the tomcat parts tho)
