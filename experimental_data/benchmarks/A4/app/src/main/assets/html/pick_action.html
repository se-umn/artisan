<p>The interaction with Android's telephony service has been severly restricted with the latest
Android major releases. This has been motivited mostly by security reasons. In order for the
app to run on different versions and devices we offer different actions to choose when
an incoming event occurs. Some are guaranteed to work on all devices, like logging or
sending a warning. Other are device/version dependent.</p>
<p>When choosing the action to perform one has to do some experimentation by calling the
device from known sources and finding the action that works. If the device is rooted, there is some
confidence that <b>DropCallByRoot</b> should work. The first time it is used it will ask for a root
privilege to be granted.</p>
<p>Our suggestion is to try first with <b>DropCallByEndCall</b>.
If it does not work try <b>DropCallByDownButton</b> followed by <b>DropCallByUpButton</b>.</p>
<p>In future versions of this app, more actions will be added to try to keep the app functioning
properly for a high percentage of devices and versions.</p>
