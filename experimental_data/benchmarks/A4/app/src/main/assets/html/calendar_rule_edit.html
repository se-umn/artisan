<p>Calendar rules are used to specify the period when a call blocking rule is active. 
The rule is specified by the days of the week when is active and the time
interval (from - to). It can be always active if all days of the week are
selected and the interval 0.00 to 23.59 is chosen.
A calendar rule must have a name, and the name must be unique: saving is disabled otherwise.</p>
<p>Editing a rule allows certain actions to be performed, but depending on the context some actions will
be disallowed (disappear from the action bar) while other will be possible and hence visible. At any
moment in time, some hints are given in the bottom purple text view, so keep an eye on it</p>
<p>These are the icons for the editing actions and their meanings:</p>
