        <p>Filters are used to customize the actions to be performed on incoming calls. Based on the
        time and date of the call and the incoming number certain actions can be triggered,
        like dropping a call, logging it or else. Hence a filter is determined by the
        <b>calendar rule</b> it uses, the <b>filter rule</b> that matches the incoming number and
        the <b>action</b> to be performed.</p>
        <p>Filters can be combined and they are acted sequentially. Typically one or two filters
        are necessary and all the filters currently defined by the user will be used. So make sure to remove
        undesired filters, if they have been created only for testing purposes and are not needed.</p>
        <p>Filters can be created, updated, edited and deleted and these are the icons for the editing actions and their meanings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="ic_save_circle.png" width="32" height="32" alt="saving"> for saving or updating a filter</li>
            <li><img src="ic_change_circle.png" width="32" height="32" alt="saving"> for changing (editing) an existing filter</li>
            <li><img src="ic_undo_circle.png" width="32" height="32" alt="saving"> for undoing changes and returning to the original filter</li>
            <li><img src="ic_delete_circle.png" width="32" height="32" alt="saving"> for deleting an existing filter</li>
            <li><img src="ic_add_circle.png" width="32" height="32" alt="saving"> for adding a new filter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once in edit or create mode, one can use the menu items in the action bar to perform the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pick a calendar rule</b> from the list of existing or create a new one</li>
            <li><b>Pick a filter rule</b> from the list of existing or create a new one</li>
            <li><b>Pick an available action</b> to be performed</li>
            <li><b>Edit the</b> currently selected <b>calendar rule</b></li>
            <li><b>Edit the</b> currently selected <b>filter rule</b>.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
