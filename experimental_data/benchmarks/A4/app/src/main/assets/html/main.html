<p>This app blocks or reacts to unwanted calls on a rule-based logic. The main-home
activity controls the turning on and off of a service that listens to incoming calls.
This service is <em>sticky</em> and survives crashes and reboots of the system.</p>
<p>When an incoming call is detected, the service loops through the list of active <b>filters</b>,
and for each filter, if there is a match, an action is performed, like dropping the call,
logging the event or sending a warning Toast message. Hence central to this design is the definition of
a <b>filter</b> object.</p>
<p>A <b>filter</b> is assembled by combining two rules and one action objects: a <b>calendar rule</b> to define
when the filter is active, a <b>filter rule</b> to define the numbers and patterns against which
the incoming call is matched and an <b>action</b> to be performed when the filter is active and
there is a match.</p>
<p>Filters can be created and edited (changed and deleted) using the "<b>Show active filters</b>" in the menu
drop-down inside the action bar. This functionality allows to create a new filter or to modify an
existing one. <b>Calendar rules</b> and <b>filter rules</b> can be created independently and then
assembled into a filter or can be created directly when creating the filter. It is <b>important to notice</b>
that all filters shown by the action "<b>Show active filters</b>" will be used by the service when an
incoming call is detected.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all menu items available from the drop-down menu:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Show active filters</b> to create and edit active filters; This is a main entry point in the use of this app</li>
    <li><b>Show latest service runs</b>, a brief summary of recent service runs, where a run is defined as the period
    between two consecutive service-start and service-stop events</li>
    <li><b>Show latest calls received</b>, a log of the incoming calls most recently received</li>
    <li><b>Show calendar rules</b>, the activity to create and edit calendar rules</li>
    <li><b>Show filter rules</b>, the activity to create and edit filter rules</li>
    <li><b>Settings</b>, a setting page for further customization</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the service is running, the main activity's page also shows a brief statistics of the total
number of calls received and triggered events, <em>i.e.</em> when the filter reacted by performing an action, since service start.
These statistics are displayed on top of two buttons that allow to navigate directly to the relevant logs: the latest
calls received and latest calls that triggered an action, respectively.</p>
