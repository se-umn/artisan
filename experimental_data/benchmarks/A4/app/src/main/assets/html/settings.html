<p>The setting activity helps customizing the usage of this app. Here is a list of the setting
that can be changes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Max size of DB query</strong> determines the number of most recent rows to be
    returned from a DB query. This can be limited to a small number to view the most recent logs, or
    can be unlimited to access the full log. It affects the logs of service runs, logged calls and
    triggered events</li>
    <li><strong>Keep call logs for</strong> gives the longevity of the logs. After the selected time
    the logs are purged</li>
    <li><strong>Show toast messages</strong> determines the verbosity of toast messages</li>
    <li><strong>Export rules</strong> allows to export all the rules in a binary format to a fixed location, shown below,
    and available on all devices under the Download directory. This can be used as an extra store of
        rules when upgrading your device</li>
    <li><strong>Import rules</strong> allows to re-import all the rules in binary format from a fixed location, shown below,
        and available on all devices under the Download directory. This can be used as an extra store of
        rules when upgrading your device</li>
    <li><strong>Show protected app dialog</strong>: certain devices, <em>e.g.</em> the Huawei recent ones,
        keep stopping the app when the screen goes off. It is possible to add this app to a protected list.
        A dialog should appear on the first usage of the app to ask for this permission,
        and then this dialog can be disabled. This setting allows to remind
        the app to re-enable this dialog again.</li>
