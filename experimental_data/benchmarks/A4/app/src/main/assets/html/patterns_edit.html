<p>Patterns are used to match an incoming telephone number to an action to be performed. Patterns can
be either a complete number, or only a part of it. A pattern like <strong>12345</strong> would match
an incoming number like <strong>12345</strong> or one containing that pattern like 0<strong>12345</strong>67.
Patterns can also contain wild cards (unspecified parts) identified by a <strong>*</strong> character, 
which can be placed in-between tokens like <strong>123*456</strong>; this will match any number
containing the two tokens separated by at least one or more other digits, 
like 0<strong>123</strong>89<strong>456</strong>12. Wild-cards at the beginning or end of the pattern are
neglected (redundant) and double wild-cards, like <strong>**</strong>, are treated as a single one.
Any other character inserted which is not a digit or a <strong>*</strong> is ignored.</p>
<p>There are four actions that can be performed to manage patterns, and which are located in the
overflow menu in the action bar:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Add a pattern</strong> to add a pattern manually</li>
	<li><strong>Pick from log</strong> to pick a number (a received phone call) from the app log</li>
	<li><strong>Delete selected patterns</strong> to remove one or more patterns, once selected. This action is only
	enabled (visible) when one or more patterns are selected.</li>
	<li><strong>Edit a single pattern</strong> to modify one pattern, once selected. This action is only enabled
	 (visible) when <strong>only one</strong> pattern is selected, and invisible otherwise</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the patterns in the filter rule have changed, click the action <em>update</em>

the filter rule and return to the parent activity.</p>
