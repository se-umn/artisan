<p>Filter rules are used to define the filters that apply to the incoming phone
    numbers in order to trigger an action.
    The rule is specified by the name, a short description and the filter patterns that
    apply to this rule. Editing of the filter patterns is done by a
    separate activity which can be accessed by clicking the main button on
    the screen. A filter rule must have a name, and the name must be unique:
    saving is disabled otherwise. Saving is also disabled whenever there are no changes to save.</p>
<p>Editing a rule allows certain action to be performed, but depending on the context some action will
    be disallowed (disappear from the action bar) while other will be possible and hence visible. At any
    moment in time, some hints are given in the bottom purple text view, so keep an eye on it</p>
<p>These are the icons for the editing actions and their meanings:</p>
