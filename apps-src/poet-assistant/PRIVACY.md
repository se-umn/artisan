Poet Assistant Privacy Policy
=============================

Poet Assistant doesn't have the `INTERNET` permission, so it is impossible for Poet Assistant to send any data over the internet.

Poet Assistant does save some data locally on your device.  This data is not accessible to other apps on the device.

* When you search for words, they are added to a local database of words to be suggested to you for future searches.  This database is not accessible to other apps. You can clear this database at any time by choosing "Clear search history" from the menu.
* When you star a word, it is saved to a local database of favorite words, unaccessible to other apps.  You can remove a single word from this database by unstarring it. You can clear all starred words by tapping on the trash can in the "Favorites" tab.
* When you type a poem, even if you don't choose "Save" from the menu, it is saved to the private preferences of the app, unaccessible to other apps on the device.  You can clear this at any time by choosing "New" from the menu, while in the "Reader" tab.
* The following additional settings are saved to the local preferences, unaccessible to other apps: theme selection, voice selection, voice speed and pitch, layout, show all rhymes toggle and word of the day toggle.  It is not possible to share or send these settings.

You can explicitly choose to use other apps to share some specific information, to whoever you want. This requires your active interaction:

* When you choose "Save" or "Save as" from the menu, to save a poem to the memory of your phone, you use the Android operating system, not the Poet Assistant app, to save the poem to the file you choose.  You may choose to save the file to a folder accessible by other applications. You, not Poet Assistant, decide where to store the file. If you want to delete a poem file you have saved, you will need to use a file browser app installed on your device to delete the file.
* You can choose to share search results or poem text using an external app, by choosing "Share" from the menu.  The app you select, and not Poet Assistant, sends the given content to who you choose to send it to.  You have complete control over to whom you want to share search results or poems.
